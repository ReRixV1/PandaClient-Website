        <a class="btnAU">Hello our team is currently working on a Minecraft client.
             We called it PandaClient. If you want to play with it you just have to download the latest version 
             of the PandaClient, unzip the .zip file and drag the PandaClientOffical folder into the version folder.
              Our goal is that everyone has free cosmetics and doesn't have to spend any money.
